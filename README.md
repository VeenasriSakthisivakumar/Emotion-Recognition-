# Emotion Recognition using Machine Learning

##  Overview  
This project focuses on **real-time emotion detection** from human facial expressions using **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision**.  
The system captures facial features from live video input and classifies emotions such as **Happy**, **Sad**, **Angry**, **Neutral**, and **Surprise** using a trained model.  

It aims to enhance **human-computer interaction** by enabling systems to understand and respond to users’ emotional states.

##  Workflow
1. **Data Collection** – Facial expression dataset (e.g., FER2013 or CK+).  
2. **Preprocessing** – Face detection, resizing, normalization.  
3. **Feature Extraction** – Using CNN/ML algorithms.  
4. **Model Training** – Classification into emotion categories.  
5. **Real-time Testing** – Webcam-based prediction using OpenCV.

##  Model Performance
- Achieved **~90% accuracy** on validation data.  
- Efficient real-time inference (under 0.1s per frame).  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add **multi-emotion detection** in group images.  
- Deploy as a **web or mobile app**.  
- Integrate with **voice emotion recognition** for multimodal emotion analysis.
